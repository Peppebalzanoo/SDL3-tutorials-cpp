# SDL3 Tutorials Collection

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of SDL3 tutorials based on the excellent work by **Lazy Foo' Productions**. These tutorials provide a comprehensive introduction to SDL3 (Simple DirectMedia Layer 3) programming in C++.

## Original Source

The tutorials are adapted from the official SDL3 tutorial series by Lazy Foo' Productions:

## About SDL3

SDL3 is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software, emulators, and popular games including Valve's award-winning catalog.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized with each tutorial in its own directory:

```

## Prerequisites

To build and run these tutorials, you'll need:

- **C++ Compiler**: MinGW-w64, Visual Studio, or similar
- **SDL3 Development Libraries**: Included in the `lib/` directory
- **SDL3_image Extension**: For PNG/JPG support
- **Windows OS**: Current setup is configured for Windows

## Building the Tutorials

Each tutorial directory contains a `build.bat` script for easy compilation:

```bash
cd 01-hello-sdl3
./build.bat
```

Or compile manually:
```bash
g++ -I../lib/SDL3-3.2.18/x86_64-w64-mingw32/include -L../lib/SDL3-3.2.18/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib -o main 01-main.cpp -lSDL3 -lSDL3_image
```

## Learning Path

These tutorials are designed to be completed in order:

1. **Start with Tutorial 01** to understand basic SDL3 concepts
2. **Progress through Tutorial 02** to learn about textures and extensions
3. **Continue with Tutorial 03** for input handling
4. **Complete Tutorial 04** for advanced graphics techniques

Each tutorial builds upon concepts from previous ones, creating a solid foundation for SDL3 development.

## Assets and Resources

The `assets/` directory contains shared media files used across tutorials:
- `hello-sdl3.bmp` - Basic bitmap image
- `loaded.png` - Default texture
- `up.png`, `down.png`, `left.png`, `right.png` - Directional sprites
- `background.png` - Background image for layering
- `foo.png` - Sprite with transparent areas
