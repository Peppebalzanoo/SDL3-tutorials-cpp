# SDL3 Tutorials Collection

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of SDL3 tutorials that serve as my personal learning implementation while studying SDL3 (Simple DirectMedia Layer 3) programming concepts. These tutorials represent my own interpretation and implementation of fundamental SDL3 concepts.

**Note**: This tutorial collection is currently under active development. More tutorials covering advanced SDL3 topics will be added as I continue my learning journey.

## About SDL3

[SDL3](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playbook software, emulators, and popular games including Valve's award-winning catalog.

## Development Environment

This project is developed using:
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **Operating System**: Windows
- **Compiler**: MinGW-w64 (GCC for Windows)
- **Build System**: Batch scripts for easy compilation

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized with each tutorial in its own directory:

## Building the Tutorials

Each tutorial directory contains a `build.bat` script optimized for MinGW-w64:

```bash
cd 01-sdl-basics
./build.bat
```

Or compile manually using MinGW-w64:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -I../lib/SDL3-3.2.18/x86_64-w64-mingw32/include -L../lib/SDL3-3.2.18/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib -o main 01-main.cpp -lSDL3 -lSDL3_image
```

## Learning Path

These tutorials are designed to be completed in order:

1. **Start with Tutorial 01** to understand basic SDL3 concepts
2. **Progress through Tutorial 02** to learn about textures and extensions
3. **Continue with Tutorial 03** for input handling
